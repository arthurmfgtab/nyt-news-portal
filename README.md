## Technologies Used

-   VueJS
-   Typescript
-   CSS
-   Cypress (via @vue/cli-plugin-e2e-cypress)
-   Jest (via @vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest)

**Note**: this was my first experience with VueJS, I figured that this assignment would be a good opportunity to learn it and build something with it (love it, by the way)
